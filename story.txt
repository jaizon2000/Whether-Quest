And so it begins...
A Knight was born with a longing destiny to be fulfilled.

Once you reached the proper age for adventure and quests,
His honor and responsibility passed down to you.

You are the only one who can keep the village safe and sane.

Among other menial tasks, your main quest is to overtake the villianous,
wicked, ferocious, 
kind of amazing, 
really handsome,

*AHEM*

-villanous villian,
Adonis
>:D

It is YOUR time to shine, would like to take on the journey of A Hero?

[DECISION 1]

Hoorah! Long live The Knight!

You gather your best, most loyal servants and soldiers...
You gather horses and stock hay...
You stock food and water, enough for months...
And most importantly, you pack Mother's Suprise Bag
Would you like take it with you?

[DECISION 2]

After a few days you hit the road.
!!! AGGRESSIVE HOG !!!
-------------------------------------------------
Welcome to your first trial.
When you are met with an interaction event, this will appear:
!!! NAME OF NPC/MONSTER !!!

Your previous or present decisions will affect your outcome to these interactions.
So, always
choose
carefully!
Good luck!
-------------------------------------------------
The hog has been huffing this whole time
and now that you have his attention, conviniently charges at you.
You knowing that Mom always knows what to pack, takes out the
***Unbreakable Dual Silver Sword/Crossbow*** that Mom packed. :)

All you & your servants & soldiers have a feast.
